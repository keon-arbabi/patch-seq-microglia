Microglia are dynamic immune cells with diverse functional roles, including the regulation of neuronal excitability. Here, we leveraged an inconvenient truth of neuronal Patch-seq datasets — that they routinely display evidence of contamination by surrounding microglia — to better understand aspects of microglia-neuronal crosstalk. We first quantified the presence of microglial transcripts in three Patch-seq datasets of human and mouse neocortical neurons and observed extensive off-target contamination by microglia in each. Variation in microglial contamination was explained foremost by donor identity, especially in human samples, and neuronal cell type identity. Differential expression testing and enrichment analyses suggest that microglial contamination in Patch-seq is reflective of activated microglia and that these transcriptional signatures are distinct from those captured via single-nucleus RNAseq. Finally, neurons with greater microglial contamination differed markedly in their electrophysiological characteristics, including lowered input resistances and more depolarized action potential thresholds. Our results suggest microglial contamination contributes to cell- and donor-related electrophysiological variability and sheds light on how microglia might impact neurons in vivo.
